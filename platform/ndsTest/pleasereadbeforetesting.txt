To run the tests in this folder (and to build
 anything for nds) you need to install the
 devkitpro nds tools. There are instructions here
 (https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Main_Page) to get
 them (Click the "Getting Started" link). They
 are hard to follow.

The tests in this folder are special because all
 nds projects in C or C++ have to built using one
 special very complicated makefile. Because of
 this, I can't test how I normally do, using my
 own makefile.

To get around this I made my own makefile which
 creates a tiny project (like the devkitpro nds
 example projects) and copies the test into it
 with the complicated makefile plus any other
 files needed for the test. My makefile then runs
 the complicated makefile in that folder to build
 the .nds file which can then be run in an
 emulator or on a real DS. Running "make clean"
 in this folder deletes all the tiny projects
 (which is normal, they can all be rebuilt again
 by running "make" which may take a while).

The file "exampleMakefile" is the complicated
 makefile which my makefile called "Makefile"
 copies into the tiny projects.
