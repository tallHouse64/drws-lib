The D lib.
D for draw.
The point of this lib is to be the most cross platform lib ever, as much as possible. If it has a screen I want to support it, (not sayong I will).

It is planned to do graphics, events and sound. This would make it a great platform to make games and other things too like video players.

The plan is to make it work on SDL2 and then NDS.
